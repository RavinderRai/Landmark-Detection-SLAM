# Landmark-Detection-SLAM

This project tracks the movement of a robot, using sensory data to estimate the robots position based on its distance from other notable landmarks positions. 
While this project is written in Python, the methodology used here heaviliy relies on linear algebra, and an understanding of vectors, matrix multiplication, 
and matrix transformations will be necessary.
